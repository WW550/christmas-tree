This is a Python script that displays a Christmas tree in text form with changing colored lights. 
The script uses the colorama library for colored text. 
If you don't have colorama installed, you can install it using pip install colorama.
Run this script to see a festive Christmas tree with "lights" that change colors every half second. 
You can stop the animation by pressing Ctrl+C.
